            <p>When you show courage in the face of adversity, you change your life and others.

                The most provocative people in the world are the ones who won't settle for average and have triumphed
                through adversity. We are most inspired by people who have experienced difficulty and never, ever give
                up.

                    after a long war. Because of the sacrifice of millions of freedom fighters we got this country. 16
                    December is our Victory Day because this day the Pakistani army surrendered.
